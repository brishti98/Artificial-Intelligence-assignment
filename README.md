Artificial Intelligence (AI):
        - Branch of Science which deals with helping machines finding solutions to complex problems in a more human-like fashion.
        -It involves borrowing characteristics from human intelligence, and applying them as algorithms in a computer friendly way.


AI Perspectives:
        - It is a methodologies of science, computation and artificial intelligence to explore how we human understand and operate in the world.

1. Acting Humanly
        - The Turing test was proposed by Alan Turing in 1950.
        - It was designed with a thought experiment that would sidestep the question “Can a machine think?” 
        - A computer passes the test if a human interrogator, after posing some written questions, cannot tell whether the written responses come from a person or from a computer.
        - For Machines to think, we would need:
                1. natural language processing to communicate successfully in a human language;
                2. knowledge representation to store what it knows or hears;
                3. automated reasoning to answer questions and to draw new conclusions;
                4. machine learning to adapt to new circumstances and to detect and extrapolate patterns.
        - To pass the total Turing test, a robot will need:
                1. computer vision and speech recognition to perceive the world;
                2. robotics to manipulate objects and move about.

2. Thinking humanly
        - We can learn about human thought in three ways:
                1. introspection—trying to catch our own thoughts as they go by;
                2. psychological experiments—observing a person in action;
                3. brain imaging—observing the brain in action.

        - Once we have a sufficiently precise theory of the mind, it becomes possible to express the theory as a computer program.
        
3. Thinking rationally
        - The Greek philosopher Aristotle was one of the first to attempt to codify “right thinking”, their study initiated the field called logic.
        - Logicians in the 19th century developed a precise notation for statements about objects in the world and the relations among them.
        - By 1965, programs could, in principle, solve any solvable problem described in logical notation. The so-called logicist tradition within artificial intelligence hopes to build on such programs to create intelligent systems.
        - The theory of probability fills this gap, allowing rigorous reasoning with uncertain information.

4. Acting rationally
        - Agents: An agent is just something that acts. Computer agents are expected to do more: operate autonomously, perceive their environment, persist over a prolonged time period, adapt to change, and create and pursue goals.
        - Rational Agents: A rational agent is one that acts so as to achieve the best outcome or, when there is uncertainty, the best expected outcome.

        1. The inception of artificial intelligence (1943–1956)
        2. Early enthusiasm, great expectations (1952–1969)
        3. A dose of reality (1966–1973)
        4. Expert systems (1969–1986)
        5. The return of neural networks (1986–present)
        6. Probabilistic reasoning and machine learning (1987– present)
        7. Big data (2001–present)
        8. Deep learning (2011–present) 
        
Foundations of AI:
1. Philosophy
        - Blaise Pascal (1623–1662) built the Pascaline in 1642 and wrote that it “produces effects which appear nearer to thought than all the actions of animals.”
        - Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646–1716) built a mechanical device intended to carry out operations on concepts rather than numbers, but its scope was rather limited. In his 1651 book Leviathan, Thomas Hobbes (1588–1679) suggested the idea of a thinking machine, an “artificial animal” in his words, arguing “For what is the heart but a spring; and the nerves, but so many strings; and the joints, but so many wheels.” He also suggested that reasoning was like numerical computation: “For ‘reason’ ... is nothing but ‘reckoning,’ that is adding and subtracting.”

2. Economics:
        - How should we make decisions in accordance with our preferences?
        - How should we do this when others may not go along?
        - How should we do this when the payoff may be far in the future?
        - The science of economics originated in 1776, when Adam Smith (1723–1790) published An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations.

3. Psychology
        - How do humans and animals think and act?
        - The origins of scientific psychology are usually traced to the work of the German physicist Hermann von Helmholtz (1821–1894) and his student Wilhelm Wundt (1832–1920).
        - In 1879, Wundt opened the first laboratory of experimental psychology, at the University of Leipzig.
        - Cognitive psychology, which views the brain as an information-processing device, can be traced back at least to the works of William James (1842–1910).
        - Helmholtz also insisted that perception involved a form of unconscious logical inference. The cognitive viewpoint was largely eclipsed by behaviorism in the United States, but at Cambridge’s Applied Psychology Unit, directed by Frederic Bartlett (1886–1969), cognitive modeling was able to flourish.

4. Linguistics
        - How does language relate to thought?
        - In 1957, B. F. Skinner published Verbal Behavior.
        - The linguist Noam Chomsky, who had just published a book on his own theory, Syntactic Structures.
        - Modern linguistics and AI, then, were “born” at about the same time, and grew up together, intersecting in a hybrid field called computational linguistics or natural language processing. The problem of understanding language turned out to be considerably more complex than it seemed in 1957. Understanding language requires an
understanding of the subject matter and context, not just an understanding of the structure of sentences. This might seem obvious, but it was not widely appreciated until the 1960s. Much of the early work in knowledge representation (the study of how to put knowledge into a form that a computer can reason with) was tied to language and informed by research in linguistics, which was connected in turn to decades of work on the philosophical analysis of language.

5. Neuroscience
        - How do brains process information?
        - Neuroscience is the study of the nervous system, particularly the brain.
        - Paul Broca’s (1824–1880) investigation of aphasia (speech deficit) in brain-damaged patients in 1861 initiated the study of the brain’s functional organization by identifying a localized area in the left hemisphere—now called Broca’s area—that is
responsible for speech production.

6. Mathematics
        - What are the formal rules to draw valid conclusions?
        - What can be computed?
        - How do we reason with uncertain information?
        - The idea of formal logic can be traced back to the philosophers of ancient Greece, India, and China, but its mathematical development really began with the work of George Boole (1815–1864), who worked out the details of propositional, or Boolean, logic (Boole, 1847).

7. Computer Engineering
        - How can we build an efficient computer?
        - The first operational computer was the electromechanical Heath Robinson,9 built in 1943 by Alan Turing’s team for a single purpose: deciphering German messages.
        - In 1943, the same group developed the Colossus, a powerful general-purpose machine based on vacuum tubes.
        - The first operational programmable computer was the Z-3, the invention of Konrad Zuse in Germany in 1941. 
        - The first electronic computer, the ABC, was assembled by John Atanasoff and his student Clifford Berry between 1940 and 1942 at Iowa State University.

8. Control Theory
        - How can artifacts operate under their own control?
        - Ktesibios of Alexandria (c. 250 BCE) built the first self-controlling machine: a water clock with a regulator that maintained a constant flow rate.
        - Modern control theory, especially the branch known as stochastic optimal control, has as its goal the design of systems that maximize a cost function over time.
